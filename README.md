Hi there! I'm a passionate software developer on an exciting journey to become both a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) and a Senior Software Engineer. My love for information security and software engineering began during my computer science studies at university. I was astonished by the complexity and creativity involved in building software and equally fascinated by the critical measures required to protect information systems.

## ðŸ’¬ Skills and Expertise:
Java (Java EE/Web Development): Proficient in building robust web applications.
Python: Basic knowledge with practical experience in web development using Django and Flask frameworks.
Web Development: Skilled in creating dynamic websites and applications using modern frameworks.
Operating Systems: Strong command over Linux.
Database Management: Knowledgeable in SQL databases.
Career Path:
I am at the beginning of my career in full-stack development, building on a solid foundation of computer science coursework from my tertiary education.

Personal Interests:
When I'm not coding, you'll likely find me behind a camera lens, capturing the beauty of the world. Photography is my creative outlet, and I'm always striving to take the best photos possible.
